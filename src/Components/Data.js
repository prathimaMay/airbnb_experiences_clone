    title: "Dramatic Dartmoor",
    description: `Active, personal, informative landscape interpretation. Allowing you full access to the millennia of human history under your feet. Live the landscape don't just see it! The granite which forms this area is approx 1000 Sq Km, bending the Earth's crust with its massive weight so that even gravity is slightly different here! Today's, mostly agricultural, National Park was once a hive of industry with granite, iron, tin and lead being mined here. The remains of these industries are there for those who know what to look for. London Bridge, now in Arizona, came from these quarries as well as many other famous London buildings. Gunpowder was also manufactured up here out of harms way. The Dartmoor men had no access to steel so they built their railway out of the most plentiful local material, granite! We will see their handiwork and marvel at their ingenuity. Living in the quarries and joined by their wives and families in the finer weather they were a tough lot. Human habitation stretches back to at least 40'000 years ago and the earliest NW European Human jawbone, post Neanderthal, was discovered here in a cave which, in modern times, is coastal. The moor can be seen as barren and with the exception of the livestock and wild ponies it is sparsely inhabited but you will leave this magical place knowing why, where, how and what it meant to our ancestors and more importantly to you!`,

    title: "Mosaic workshops in Torquay",
    description: `Once you arrive at the hub I will show you which projects you can make (Coasters, boxes, flower pots, photo franes) Usually we manage 2 small mosaics or one larger one. Not everyone takes the same time. If you know you like to take your time being creative I would make sure you have not anything else booked immediately after. If you need to leave at 12.30, please let me know on the day. You will get complimentary tea or coffee. There is a large selection of different mosaic tiles and you are fee to choose your own creative design. Once you are happy with your design we will stick it on the base you chose and when it is complete I will grout the project for you. You can take it home on the day and leave the grout to dry over night. All you have to do is give it a final wipe with a wet cloth in the morning. All projects are individual and it is lovely how many different designs there are. The main aim is to switch off from everything else and just have a good time being creative.
    Other things to note...
    The experience is suitable for ages 5+
    The tiles are precut or I cut them for you.
    I am happy to help with anything and the workshop is very flexible. I look forward to welcoming you.`,
